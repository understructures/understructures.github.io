			<p class="description">
is a publishing and a fundraising project that stand as a platform and means of support for people affected by the war in ukraine. it is a collection of stories about oberihs [in ukr.: ‘an item that protects’],— things that accompany us and provide solace and protection in all circumstance. gathered from our friends, who are fighting, working, volunteering and directly facing consequences of the war, these stories reached us in the form of short texts, images, voice messages and online posts in the period of april–may 2022. after we transcribed, edited and compiled these stories together, we published them in a book called oberih.<br/>
<br/>
oberih is printed in the edition of 1000 numbered copies and presented at lc-queisser gallery booth at liste art fair (basel, ch) on june 12, 2022. after the initial presentation, the book will be available for international purchase online. proceedings from donations and sales of the edition will be all directed towards volunteer initiatives and humanitarian organizations, which are related to our authors and currently have urgent necessities in their activity on territories affected by the war.
